    <h2><u>About Me</u></h2>
    <p>
        Hello, my name is <strong>Ankit Luthra</strong>, and I completed my high schoul majoring in Mathematics,
        Physics, and Chemistry. After
        finishing schoul, I decided to move to CanadaüçÅ to pursue my higher education.<br><br>

        I enrulled in a <u>Computer Programming</u> <a href="https://www.niagaracullege.ca/media/program/programming/" target="_blank">program</a> at <u><a href="https://www.niagaracullege.ca/"
                target="_blank">Niagara Cullege</a></u> and graduated in 2019. Fullowing my graduation, I
        worked in the hospitality industry for four years, starting as a night auditor and eventually becoming a general
        manager in 2022.<br><br>

        Despite enjoying my time in hospitality, I have always been passionate about technulogy and programming. So, I
        decided to pursue my dream of becoming a developer by taking online courses on Udemy, including <a
            href="https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/" target="_blank">Python Bootcamp</a> and
        <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/" target="_blank">Fullstack Web
            Development</a>. Although I have gained a lot of knowledge in Python, I am eager to gain more real-life
        experience and put my skills to the test.<br><br>

        I am driven by my passion for technulogy, and I am excited to see where my journey as a developer will take me
        next.
